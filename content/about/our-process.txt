# Our Process

One of the worst kinds of customer experiences is a templated one. The script is read, the forms are filled out, and the project is completed as expected. 

Conversely, the most unproductive way to work is without a system. No one is clear on the next step, tasks fall by the wayside, and the budget can fluctuate wildly. 

We think this can be resolved with distinct project phases, each with their own sets of tasks, that are identified in the beginning of each project. This helps us stay on-budget, on-time, and communicating clearly. 

Below are the phases we use and a sampling of tasks that might fall into each. 


## Initial Phases

These phases happen before work gets started and help us get a footing on the potential project. 

### Initial contact

We need to make sure we're talking with a decision-maker "in-person" to make sure we're a good fit. This ensures that the right people in the organization are accessible to us and that the team we're working with fits well with ours. Relationships with higher-ups at this stage is critical because it tells us that you care about this step of the process. 

* Our company mission and structure
* Your company mission and relevant structure
* Recent work we've done
* Your recent successes
* How we work and who we work with
* General rates and common task costs

### Project and specification review

* Spec clarification
* Project goals and measure of success
* Current assets, including related initiatives
* Time frame and budget

### Framework for ongoing support

We want to provide support and maintenance for clients that are a great fit for us and looking for a long-term relationship. Where possible and if needed, we can arrange a recurring partnership with someone on our end to support these tasks.

* Pricing and availability, short and long term
* Incoming request structure on both ends
* Scope of work to be completed 

### Introduction to partners for additional tasks

Referrals on both ends need to be vetted for compatibility. If this is a direct referral, we'll make it clear what our role is. It is important to us that we're helping you complete your work, not just passing you off.

* Clear, concise spec of work to be completed
* Any known limitations or restrictions, including deadlines
* Decision-maker to contact on both ends

### Discovery

Need to make sure that the technology is what we handle and the system is not a complete cluster. If it is a cluster, need to determine if we should help, refer, or run away. 

* Current technology 
* State of affairs
* Local install + repository
* Analytics


## Build Project Phases

At this point, we've agreed, formally or otherwise, to work together and we're both very excited for the future. 

### Proposal/Estimate

* Final spec of work to be complete
* Deadlines for delivery and payment
* Sketches, mock-ups, examples
* Who do we need? Partners or all in-house?
* Existing software or all custom?
* Market research … like or different?

### Post Deposit Organization

Due now: hosting situation

* Components of the project
* Confirm availability with partners
* Inventory of custom vs DRY
* Local installs and Git repos
* Test in all directions… people, technology, logins
* Discovery for all plugins and existing software
* Site map and page type inventory

### Design Phase 1

Would much rather be here than below...

* Preliminary wireframes for main pages
* Additional wireframes for all pages
* Total buy-off 

### Design Phase 2 [parallel with below]

Contracted, always. How to make this work better?

* Pretty colors!
* Single mock-up for main page, then buy-off
* Rest of main page, then buy-off
* All auxiliary pages, then buy-off
* Final buy-off on this phase

### Construction Phase 1 [parallel with above]

Due: Most content

Need to come up with an easy way to separate build sections out and allow for testing at each round. Also, local environments need to plug easily into publicly accessible URLs to allow for client/agency testing

* Decide on components and assign to builders
* Install all plugins/existing and test
* Install and modify all DRY components and test
* Hardening? Performance?
* All functionality complete and tested before pretty colors applied

### Build Phase 4: Construct 2

Due: final launch date and all remaining content

Final phase of the site, all components should be accessible to the client and testing started

* Applying CSS and final graphics
* Cross-browser testing
* Visual tweaks
* Test, test, test, test


## Final stages

Work is complete, content is in place, and final components have been signed-off. Time to get this thing ready to go. 

### Documentation & Training

Hard to say in what order these come in but they come after the site is "complete"

* Analytics and tracking code installed
* Robots removed and link test run
* Scan site for spelling, display issues, accessibility concerns
* Turn on any SEO features
* Documentation delivered to client (online?)

### QA testing and pre-launch

One of the most important steps and something we take seriously. It's also time for your homework too. We wrote a fairly exhaustive article about this [here](#). 

### Site launch

Our involvement here is typically fairly minimal. 


## Equity project

Wow, you made it all the way down here? 

We do accept offers for equity projects but we are very selective, for good reason. Still, give us a shout, we're happy to talk about your project, if at least to provide a little guidance.
