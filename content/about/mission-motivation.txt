# Mission and Motivation

Every business should have a reason for existing. This reason can be split into two pieces: the mission (what you aspire to) and the motivation (what keeps you plugging away). Please, allow us to share ours. 

## Mission

This is what we aspire to. Our mission has 3 parts:

### Project first

What we create online lives on, potentially for decades. We take pride in what we produce and have the ability to help you do the same. That's why we put the project first.

Putting the project first means that we will voice our concerns, recommendations, and warnings clearly and early. Most of the time these are minor changes but some are show-stoppers. We're not afraid to go back to the drawing board. 

Our clients are partners in short-term ventures. We work with people who know their industry and it's our responsibility to do the same. That's why you won't see the word "service provider" anywhere on our site. 

### Transparency

As a technology company, we know we can get away with a lot because so much of what we do is a black box. We choose not to do this. 

Being transparent means helping you understand what we do. We accomplish this through clear communication, appropriate documentation, and simple implementation.

You might not understand everything that went into your project but at least you can know that nothing was hidden. Ask anything you'd like; no question is a dumb one. 

### Improvement 

The only way to keep building good things, online and off, is to continually improve everything about what you do: your people, your process, your tools, everything. 

Our approach is an iterative one to everything we do. A component of building is making mistakes and these mistakes help us all improve.

We rely on certain design and development standards to make good overall decisions. Improvement includes refining and testing these standards to avoid repetitive errors. 

## Motivation

You know what we strive for but what keeps us striving?

* We thrive on learning. Even the most mundane tasks have a research and learning component built in. You can't make good web without study. 
* We love to help others do better. We're not perfect but we know a thing or two. The best thing we can do with the knowledge we've acquired is to share it. 
* We create things we're proud of. Without pride in workmanship, there is no sense of ownership and, hence, less motivation to do better. 
* We ship often and iterate. This means we're not scared of making mistakes and we're not scared of unfinished projects going live. Let's learn something as soon as possible. Stay Lean. 
* We want to work better as human beings. This means we take time off, are not glued to our email, and work in a way that keeps us healthy. That doesn't mean we go missing, it means we're great at setting expectations. 
* We're partners, not vendors. Whether our relationship is short or long term, we're working together to do the best we can. If that's not appealing, just let us know early.
