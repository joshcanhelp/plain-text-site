# What is it that we do

All businesses should define what they do clearly and stick to it. Expansion into new services and products should be a conscious, deliberate move towards a goal. Web design and development companies are the worst at this. 

The problem comes from two things: what we do is largely incomprehensible to our clients and what's involved with a strong, healthy web presence is near-endless. Put these two together and you have a recipe for a jack-of-all-web-trades company that can't keep up. 

Our desire is not to be a one-stop shop, it's to do what we do really well for clients that appreciate the focus and quality. As such, we work with a limited set of tools, itemized below.

## Who we work with

We're not a "one-size-fits-all" shop and we created our work flow and processes to provide specific development work (next section) to specific people. 

Structurally, you're likely a:

* Design company of 1 or more people
* Technology company without experience in the specific fields below
* Tech-savvy small business who is already online but has some big ideas

Philosophically, you likely:

* Were nodding your head when you read our Mission and Motivation
* Feel pretty cool telling people what your company does
* Enjoy what you do and take pride in what you create


## What we do

Some of the below is open to interpretation. We're welcome to field any questions you have about what we create; we'll always be honest about where our strengths lie. 

* Ground-up PHP and MySQL development (applications, custom classes, etc)
* Existing PHP or Javascript application modification
* Custom WordPress or Drupal site builds, configurations and modifications
* WordPress plugins and custom themes
* Drupal modules and custom themes
* Front-end engineering projects, including UI/UX layout and design

## What we use

We work with open source technology as much as possible. If it's not on the list, we probably don't do it.

* HTML5, XHTML
* CSS (2, 3)
* Javascript
* PHP
* MySQL
* Git
* WordPress
* Drupal/Pressflow
* jQuery
* LAMP servers (not provisioning or management)
* Google Analytics

We're actively exploring the tools below. If you're OK with a little experimentation and a longer implementation (combined with a lower project cost), let's give it a try. 

* Yii
* Concrete5
* MongoDB
* Node.js
* bbPress
