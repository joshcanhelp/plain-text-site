# plain-text-site

This is my attempt at a very light-weight "CMS" of sorts. Using the [Twig templating engine](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), this project lets you create pages, posts, and special outputs using callback functions. 

Content for my upcoming site is included as example text. At some point this will be replaced with dummy content.
