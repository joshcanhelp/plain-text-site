# plain-text-site

This is my attempt at a very light-weight "CMS" of sorts. Using the [Twig templating engine](https://github.com/fabpot/Twig) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), this project lets you create pages, posts, and special outputs using callback functions. 

At the moment, the content and routes are more for my site than really globally-useful versions of anything. Once the development here is complete, this will all be cleaned out and made more "pret a porter." 

Yes, I'll also write some useful documentation!
